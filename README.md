# Algorithms-1
Welcome!
1. Start by reviewing the topics and concepts that are typically covered in algorithms exams, such as data structures, searching and sorting algorithms, and basic graph algorithms.
2. Practice solving algorithmic problems using online resources, such as coding challenges and practice exams.
3. Create a study plan and schedule dedicated time to review and practice algorithmic concepts on a regular basis leading up to the exam.
4. Use a variety of study materials, such as textbooks, lecture notes, and online tutorials, to ensure you have a well-rounded understanding of the topics covered on the exam.
5. Work on developing your problem-solving skills by studying and analyzing the solutions to algorithmic problems.
6. As you study, focus on understanding the underlying principles and techniques used in algorithms, rather than simply memorizing specific solutions.
7. Prioritize your studies based on your strengths and weaknesses, and spend extra time on the topics and concepts that you struggle with.
8. Take practice exams or quizzes to test your knowledge and identify areas where you need to focus your studies.
9. Seek help from classmates, teachers, or tutors if you are struggling to understand a particular concept or problem.
10. On the day of the exam, arrive early and make sure you have all the necessary materials, such as a calculator and pencils. Take a few moments to relax and clear your mind before starting the exam. Work through the exam systematically and carefully, and make sure to check your work before submitting it.

## 1. KMP 
The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm is a string matching algorithm that is used to find the occurrence of a pattern within a larger string. The algorithm uses a preprocessing step to construct a "failure function" that helps it quickly skip over portions of the larger string that do not match the pattern, allowing it to find the pattern in linear time.

### The KMP algorithm works as follows:

Preprocess the pattern by constructing a "failure function" that stores the length of the longest proper prefix of the pattern that is also a suffix of the pattern. This function is used to quickly skip over portions of the larger string that do not match the pattern.

Initialize a pointer i to the start of the larger string and a pointer j to the start of the pattern.

Compare the character at the ith position of the larger string with the jth character of the pattern. If they match, increment both i and j and continue to the next characters. If they do not match, use the failure function to determine how much of the pattern to skip and then continue the comparison with the next character in the larger string.

Repeat step 3 until either the pattern is found (j equals the length of the pattern) or the end of the larger string is reached (i equals the length of the larger string).

If the pattern was found, return the position at which it was found. If the end of the larger string was reached, return -1 to indicate that the pattern was not found.

### The KMP algorithm has a time complexity of O(m+n), where m is the length of the pattern and n is the length of the larger string, making it much faster than naive string matching algorithms that have a time complexity of O(m*n).

## 2. Divide and conquer
Divide and conquer is an algorithm design paradigm that involves dividing a problem into smaller subproblems, solving the subproblems recursively, and then combining the solutions to the subproblems to solve the original problem. This approach can be used to solve a wide variety of problems, from sorting and searching to optimization and graph algorithms.

### The divide and conquer paradigm has several key steps:

Divide the problem into smaller subproblems. This typically involves dividing the input data into smaller pieces, such as splitting a large array into smaller arrays.

Solve the subproblems recursively. This involves applying the same divide and conquer approach to each of the subproblems, continuing to divide them into smaller subproblems until they can be solved directly.

Combine the solutions to the subproblems to solve the original problem. This typically involves combining the solutions to the subproblems in some way, such as merging sorted arrays or combining partial solutions to an optimization problem.

### One of the key advantages of the divide and conquer paradigm is that it allows for parallelization, as the subproblems can be solved independently and then combined to solve the original problem. This can make divide and conquer algorithms much faster than other algorithms on parallel hardware.

## 3. Greedy algorithm
A greedy algorithm is an algorithm that follows the principle of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. In other words, a greedy algorithm makes the best choice it can at each step, without worrying about the consequences for future steps.

The greedy approach is often used to solve optimization problems, where the goal is to find the best possible solution to a problem given a set of constraints. To do this, a greedy algorithm will iteratively make the locally optimal choice, with the hope that these choices will lead to a globally optimal solution.

### One of the key advantages of greedy algorithms is their simplicity. They are easy to understand and implement, and they often have good performance in practice. However, they are not always guaranteed to find the optimal solution, as they can be susceptible to "getting stuck" in locally optimal solutions that are not globally optimal.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
