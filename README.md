# Algorithms-1
Welcome!

## 1. KMP 
The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm is a string matching algorithm that is used to find the occurrence of a pattern within a larger string. The algorithm uses a preprocessing step to construct a "failure function" that helps it quickly skip over portions of the larger string that do not match the pattern, allowing it to find the pattern in linear time.

### The KMP algorithm works as follows:

Preprocess the pattern by constructing a "failure function" that stores the length of the longest proper prefix of the pattern that is also a suffix of the pattern. This function is used to quickly skip over portions of the larger string that do not match the pattern.

Initialize a pointer i to the start of the larger string and a pointer j to the start of the pattern.

Compare the character at the ith position of the larger string with the jth character of the pattern. If they match, increment both i and j and continue to the next characters. If they do not match, use the failure function to determine how much of the pattern to skip and then continue the comparison with the next character in the larger string.

Repeat step 3 until either the pattern is found (j equals the length of the pattern) or the end of the larger string is reached (i equals the length of the larger string).

If the pattern was found, return the position at which it was found. If the end of the larger string was reached, return -1 to indicate that the pattern was not found.

### The KMP algorithm has a time complexity of O(m+n), where m is the length of the pattern and n is the length of the larger string, making it much faster than naive string matching algorithms that have a time complexity of O(m*n).

## 2. Divide and conquer
Divide and conquer is an algorithm design paradigm that involves dividing a problem into smaller subproblems, solving the subproblems recursively, and then combining the solutions to the subproblems to solve the original problem. This approach can be used to solve a wide variety of problems, from sorting and searching to optimization and graph algorithms.

### The divide and conquer paradigm has several key steps:

Divide the problem into smaller subproblems. This typically involves dividing the input data into smaller pieces, such as splitting a large array into smaller arrays.

Solve the subproblems recursively. This involves applying the same divide and conquer approach to each of the subproblems, continuing to divide them into smaller subproblems until they can be solved directly.

Combine the solutions to the subproblems to solve the original problem. This typically involves combining the solutions to the subproblems in some way, such as merging sorted arrays or combining partial solutions to an optimization problem.

### One of the key advantages of the divide and conquer paradigm is that it allows for parallelization, as the subproblems can be solved independently and then combined to solve the original problem. This can make divide and conquer algorithms much faster than other algorithms on parallel hardware.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
